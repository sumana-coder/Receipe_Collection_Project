# 🍽️ Recipe Collection Project


# The Recipe Collection Website is a simple, responsive, and visually appealing web application designed to display a curated list of popular recipes. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project showcases each recipe as a card containing an image, title, short description, and a “View Details” button (for potential future enhancement). The goal of this project is to provide users with a user-friendly interface to explore different food items—whether for casual browsing or inspiration in the kitchen.
